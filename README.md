## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to look at key metrics of New York Citi Bike data, so that I might be able to start a similar program for my hometown in Des Moines, Iowa. To do this, I used public bike data from New York, and used Tableau to visualized key metrics associated with that data. 

## Results
- [Breakdown by Gender](images/Gender_Breakdown.png)
    - The first thing we looked at was the breakdown of bikers by gender. Based on this pie chart, we can see that a majority of the bikers that used citi bikes were male. 
- [Peak Start Time in August](images/August_Peak_Hours.png)
    - The next metric we looked at was the most popular times to use the citi bikes were. Based on this bar chart, we can see that most people started riding between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.
- [Checkout Length for Users](images/Checkout_Times_for_Users.png)
    - Another item we wanted to look out was how long people tend to check out the bikes for. Based on this graph, the most users checked out the bikes for roughly 5 hours.
- [Checkout Length by Gender](images/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)
    - After looking at the checkout length for all users, we wanted to see the breakdown by gender. Based on the graph, both male and female users used the most trip durations were between 4 and 6 hours.
- [Trips by Weekday for Each Hour](images/Trips_by_Weekday_for_Each_Hour.png)
    - Next we created a heat map to show which day and time of the week had the most rides. Based on this map, we can see that the most popular day and time is Thursday at 5pm. 
- [Trips by Weekday for Each Gender](images/Trips_by_Weekday_for_Each_Gender.png)
    - In this heat map, we expanded on the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, and included gender in the breakdown. As you can see from this heat map, Thursday at 5pm is the most popular due to a lot of males riding citi bikes during this time period. 
- [Type of User by Gender](imgaes/User_Trips_by_Gender.png)
    - Finally, we wanted to look at the breakdown of Usertype by gender. The two user types are Customer and Subscriber. Interestingly, there isn't much of a difference between genders for the Customer Usertype, but for the people that subscribe to citibike, males use it a lot more frequently.

## Summary
Based off of this information, it can be assumed that the majority of people in NYC that use CitiBike are males that work inside the city. The most used days are during the weekday, and the most used hour is 5pm, which is when most people get off of work. For this program to work in Des Moines, we need to look at the population of males working downtown. 
Another vizualization I would recommend would be to map the distance of rides in relation to the day, and in relation to the hour. If people are using these bikes in NYC as a means to get home, it can be assumed they live within biking distance. If this is going to work in Des Moines, we need to make sure the males working downtown don't live far away from their offices, otherwise, they would be unlikely to use a bike to get home after work.
